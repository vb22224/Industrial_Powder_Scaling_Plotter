The scripts required to plot the data required for the paper entitled "The Scaling of Triboelectric Charging Powder Drops for Industrial Applications".

Drop_Plotter.py                -> Plots the Faraday cup data traces and allows the extraction of the overall charging data.
Mass_Against_Charge_Plotter.py -> Plots the overall charging data for comparison with mass.
Mastersizer_Direct_Plotter.py  -> Plots the Malvern 3000 particle size data.
